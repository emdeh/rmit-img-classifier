This file is for utility functions used to load data and pre-process images.

Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability 
of that name. That is, you'll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return 
the flower name and class probability.

Basic usage: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint
Options:
    Return top K most likely classes: 
        python predict.py input checkpoint --top_k 3

    Use a mapping of categories to real names:
        python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_to_name.json

    Use GPU for inference:
        python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu

The best way to get the command line input into the scripts is with the argparse module(opens in a new tab) in the standard library. You can also find a nice tutorial for argparse here(opens in a new tab).
