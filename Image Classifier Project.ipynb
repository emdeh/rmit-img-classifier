    "# Developing an AI application\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/Flowers.png' width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is broken down into multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n",
    "* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n",
    "* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code. As you work through this notebook and find you need to import a package, make sure to add the import up here."

The data should be included alongside this notebook, otherwise you can [download it here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz). The dataset is split into three parts, training, validation, and testing. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. You'll also need to make sure the input data is resized to 224x224 pixels as required by the pre-trained networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation and testing sets are used to measure the model's performance on data it hasn't seen yet. For this you don't want any scaling or rotation transformations, but you'll need to resize then crop the images to the appropriate size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-trained networks you'll use were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For all three sets you'll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`, calculated from the ImageNet images.  These values will shift each color channel to be centered at 0 and range from -1 to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll want to use `PIL` to load the image ([documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/Image.html)). It's best to write a function that preprocesses the image so it can be used as input for the model. This function should process the images in the same manner used for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, resize the images where the shortest side is 256 pixels, keeping the aspect ratio. This can be done with the [`thumbnail`](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) or [`resize`](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) methods. Then you'll need to crop out the center 224x224 portion of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color channels of images are typically encoded as integers 0-255, but the model expected floats 0-1. You'll need to convert the values. It's easiest with a Numpy array, which you can get from a PIL image like so `np_image = np.array(pil_image)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. You'll want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, PyTorch expects the color channel to be the first dimension but it's the third dimension in the PIL image and Numpy array. You can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html). The color channel needs to be first and retain the order of the other two dimensions."
